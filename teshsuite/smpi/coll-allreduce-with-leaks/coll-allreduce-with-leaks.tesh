> If this is too much, consider sharing allocations for computation buffers.
> Largest allocation at once from a single process was 64 bytes, at coll-allreduce-with-leaks.c:27. It was called 16 times during the whole simulation.
> Running smpirun with -wrapper "valgrind --leak-check=full" can provide more information
> This can be done automatically by setting --cfg=smpi/auto-shared-malloc-thresh to the minimum size wanted size (this can alter execution if data content is necessary)
